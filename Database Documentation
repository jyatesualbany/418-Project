TestTaker Database Documentation
-I’ve changed a couple of data type names. I also added the Test table like we talked about at the sprint planning meeting. 
Below is all the code I used to create them and fill them with test data. Feel free to take a look as you develop code for them.

-Also, don’t forget that you guys can make a where clause to limit the search when you’re going through databases. 
I just realized Megan was using a C# loop to go through the whole thing, but that kind of makes the database pointless. 
Here’s an example…
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE USER_NAME = 'user_admin';

-Just in case, don’t forget that you can limit the search too by replacing the * with a Column name. For example…
SELECT PASSWORD FROM Users WHERE USER_NAME = 'user_admin';



CREATE TABLE Users(
USER_NAME varchar(20) PRIMARY KEY,
PASSWORD varchar(20) NOT NULL,
ADMIN BIT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO Users VALUES('user_loser','password',0);
INSERT INTO Users VALUES('user_admin','Betterpassword',1);



CREATE TABLE Questions(
QUESTION_ID int PRIMARY KEY,
CATEGORY varchar(20) NOT NULL,
TRUE_FALSE BIT NOT NULL,
QUESTION_TEXT varchar(100) NOT NULL,
ANS1 varchar(100),
ANS2 varchar(100),
ANS3 varchar(100),
ANS4 varchar(100)
);

INSERT INTO Questions VALUES(
1,
'Ducks',
0,
'What sound does a duck make?',
'The walls have eyes',
'Pikachu!',
'Kermit the frog here!',
'*Quack!'
);
//Asterix in front of answer means it is the correct one.

INSERT INTO Questions(QUESTION_ID,CATEGORY,TRUE_FALSE,QUESTION_TEXT) VALUES(
2,
'Ducks',
1,
'Does Donald Duck wear pants?'
);
//If there is no asterix before the question in a true/false question text then the answer is false.




CREATE TABLE Test_Titles(
TEST_ID int PRIMARY KEY,
TEST_TITLE varchar(20),
);

INSERT INTO Test_Titles VALUES (1, 'Duck Test #1');
INSERT INTO Test_Titles VALUES (2, 'Math Test');


CREATE TABLE Tests(
TEST_ID int,
QUESTION_ID int,
FOREIGN KEY(TEST_ID) REFERENCES Test_Titles(TEST_ID),
FOREIGN KEY(QUESTION_ID) REFERENCES Questions(QUESTION_ID)
);

INSERT INTO Tests VALUES (1, 1);
INSERT INTO Tests VALUES (1, 2);
